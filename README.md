### Portfolio Website

demo: https://near99.github.io/personal-portfolio/

the stylesheet looks awful.

I was thinking to style each page differently but it requires lots of works on styling.

There's not much of fun I can get from styling so I will just use the about layout for project page.

I cleaned up contact page a bit and left it as simple as possible, have to add page jumps for that.

### What has been done so far?

1. All pages layout and styling have been done except for resume which will be a pdf file only.

2. Able to switch between light and dark theme.

3. Able to switch languages (English & Chinese).

### Improvements?

1. Well, countless I think.

2. I wanna add more animations and smooth jumping pages back and forth.

3. Functionalities of this page is super limited and basic.

4. It sounds good to add a blog page. Maybe after learning Node, still in progress.

5. At first I wanted to code a resume page but... I hate styling.

6. For recruiters if you happend to see this please do not recommend me a role that requires a lot of styling works, I really can't take it. Appreciate it.
